<hr><h2>GnuPG encryption plugin for the Geany IDE</h2><hr>
<p>
This is a plugin for the <a href="http://www.geany.org/">Geany</a> IDE
 to provide <a href="http://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> encryption.
</p><p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
This plugin is distributed with geany-plugins, to install check the
documentation of the geany-plugins release.<br>
Like all plugins GeanyPG can be activated via the Tools > Plugin
Manager dialog.
</p><p>
<h4>Using GeanyPG</h4>
Once the plugin has been activated a new sub-menu named `GeanyPG' will appear in the Tools menu.<br>
This sub-menu contains the following options:
<ul>
 <li>Encrypt</li>
 <li>Sign</li>
 <li>Decrypt / Verify</li>
 <li>Verify detached signature</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h5>Encryption</h5>
To encrypt a file, simply choose Encrypt from the menu. A dialog will
open allowing you to select any recipients. At the bottom of the dialog
you also have to option to choose a key to sign the text with (Default
is None).
</p><p>
When you press Ok, a few things can happen. If you haven't selected any
recipients a new dialog will open asking you if you want to use a
symmetric cipher. If you choose yes you will be asked for a passphrase
that will be used to encrypt the text.</p><p>
What happens when you have selected one or more recipients, or entered
a passphrase for a symmetric cipher, depends on whether any text was
selected. If you have selected text, <b>only</b> the selected text will
be encrypted, otherwise the whole file will be encrypted.<br>
Of course, if you have chosen to sign the text as well, you will first
be asked for the passphrase of the selected private key.
</p><p>
<h5>Signing without encrypting</h5>
To sign some text without also encrypting it, choose Sign from the menu.
You will be asked which private key you want to use and to enter the
passphrase for that key.<br>
Like when encrypting the text, if you have selected anything, only the
selected text will be signed. Otherwise the whole file will be signed.
</p><p>
<h5>Decrypting and Verifying</h5>
To decrypt a file or verify an inline signature just select the GPG
code and choose Decrypt / Verify from the menu. When decrypting you
will of course be asked to enter a passphrase.
</p><p>
<h5>Verifying detached signatures</h5>
To verify a detached signature choose the last option from the menu. A
dialog will open where you can select a .sig or .asc file with a
detached signature.

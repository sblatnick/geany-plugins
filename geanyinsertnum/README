Insert Numbers Plugin
=====================

About
-----
This plugin replaces a (possibly zero-width) rectangular selection with
integer numbers, using start/step/base etc. specified by the user.
For practical reasons, the number of lines is limited to 250000.
Lines shorter than the current selection are skipped.


Requirements
------------
Geany 0.19 or later and the respective headers and development libraries.


Installation
------------
This plugin is part of the geany-plugins project.
See the README file of that package.


Usage
-----
Select a rectangle and choose Tools -> Insert Numbers.


Known issues
------------
If you reload the current file while the plugin is running (after pressing
OK), the insertion may fail. Use Edit -> Undo to fix the file if needed.

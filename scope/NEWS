Scope 0.94 (2015-10-01):

    * Better GDB I/O based on Geany spawn, consequently removed
      gdb_buffer_length, gdb_send_interval and gdb_wait_death.
      To leave the Windows console open on program termination,
      set breakpoints at ExitProcess / TerminateProcess.
      Geany 1.25+ required.


Scope 0.93.2 (2014-02-13):

    * Remember the total (initial) breakpoint ignore count and
      restore it on each run. Saving the current (remaining) value
      across restarts was not very useful.


Scope 0.93.1 (2014-01-06):

    * Show breakpoint origin in the type column, with tooltip.

    * Show catchpoint condition (depends on the gdb version).

    * Apply any unapplied breakpoints/inspects marked as "Apply on
      run" on each run (only important if "Auto run/exit" is off).


Scope 0.92 (2013-09-07)

    * Better support for Geany message window on right, but don't
      expect miracles.

    * Apply VTE and Debug panel position preferences immediately.


Scope 0.91.2 (2013-07-25)

    * Fixed various errors on plugin unload-and-reload.


Scope 0.91.1 (2013-07-11)

    * (Un)Block toolbar Toggle Breakpoint when saving a document or
      switching to another document.

    * Added F77 to the list of gdb-supported source file types.


Scope 0.91 (2013-07-05)

    * Better support for float frame Inspect variables.

    * Unified and documented the Watch/Memory/Inspect update policy.


Scope 0.90 (2013-06-24)

    * Added Registers next to Inspect.

    * Display win32 error texts instead of codes.

    * Changing the thread/frame honours "Update all views".


Scope 0.89 (2013-05-17)

    * Small fixes and improvements. This should be the last version
      before a Registers view is added.


Scope 0.87 (2013-04-14)

    * Performance improvements for large Inspect tree and large number
      of Threads, Breakpoints etc.

    * Added GTK+ 3 support.

    * Removed the stash_tree based scope configuration page in
      Edit -> Plugin Preferences - required a patched Geany.


Scope 0.82 (2013-01-15)

    * Added Memory subpage.

    * Fixed compatibility with glib-2.20.


Scope 0.80 (2013-01-02)

   * Mark all data views for update when a value is modified.
     Simpler and more reliable; generates a bit larger gdb traffic.

   * Select, focus and align tree elements as needed instead of simply
     selecting.


Scope 0.79 (2012-12-27)

   * Easier sync between Scope/GDB thread/frame.


Scope 0.78 (2012-12-23)

   * Added option "keep_exec_point" to keep the execution point marker
     and Threads location column when a thread execution is resumed.


Scope 0.77 (2012-12-16)

   * Support for " and \ in evaluate expressions.


Scope 0.76 (2012-12-13)

   * Per-function display of @entry arguments.
